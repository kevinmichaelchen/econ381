* describe self-reports health table  
* include our hypothesis before we run regression  
* section talking more about forced coexistence  
* say WE ARE NOT using forced coexistence as an IV  
* diff-in-diff between states/regions more likely to be forced coex vs less likely to be forced coex (just SPATIAL, not TEMPORAL)  
* discuss why some individual diseases are low-frequency events vs less observation  
* include OTHER diseases column  
* combine indivudal diseases into 2 camps: chronic vs non-chronic (more disaggregated than all causes, but not as much as cancer).  
* discuss that it would have been nice to get state-by-state income data and do an interaction term  
* include table forced coexistence (with no income) on self-reported status  
* explain why sample size changes in income regression  
* combine (nearpoor and poor) so we have 2 tables instead of 6  
* explain why we include the specific states we do in our definition of forced coexistence (why only CA?)  
* pretty confident in mortality figures published by CDC  
* talk about missing data issue - missing for some diseases at some point in time - too few to estimate they put a dot/missing
